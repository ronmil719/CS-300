# CS-300

For CS-300, the problem I was solving for was to write code that prints out coursework in alphabetic order. The ZyBook activities were extemely helpful in learning and furthering my education. The challanges are not too complex where it was lost on me, but rather very insightful. When facing a roadblock, I also referenced outside sources such as Stack Overflow. When I found myself stumped, it was very helpful to see other people's work to correct myself. My work on this project expanded my approach by showcasing the ability to utilize several different approaches to get to the final result. This will be helpful to show that there is no roadblock too large that I could not traverse a different path but arrive at the proper goal. This will surely be helpful when attempting tasks for the first time. I have always attempted to approach my projects with the ability for readable, maintainable, and adaptable as possible to remind myself that hopefully one day I will be doing this for a tech company and must achieve the highest possible outcome. Data structure is extremely important in regards to properly utilizing my time to ensure I am not creating more work for myself with having to return to previous tasks and having no choice but to correct any issues before moving forward.
